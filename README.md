## ðŸ‘‹ Hey there,
I am a passionate and experienced Full Stack Developer with over 20 years of expertise in building innovative and scalable web applications. My focus lies in utilizing cutting-edge AI tools like GPT (OpenAI), Claude, Gemini, DALLÂ·E, and MidJourney to deliver intelligent solutions for businesses, with a particular emphasis on crafting Software as a Service (SaaS) products.

I am deeply committed to a simplistic MVP (Minimum Viable Product) approach, ensuring efficient, streamlined development that meets core business needs without unnecessary complexity. With extensive experience in team leadership and business management, I bring a strong blend of technical skill and business insight to every project.

The contributions seen on my profile ar **only for my personal projects**. For my work I use a self-hosted GitLab service.
