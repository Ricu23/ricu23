# 👋 Hey there,
I am a passionate and experienced Full Stack Developer with **over 20 years of expertise** in building innovative and scalable web applications.     
I released my first website in 2004 🤯 and it's still active today.    
These days, my focus lies in utilizing cutting-edge AI tools like GPT (OpenAI), Claude, Gemini, DALL·E, and MidJourney to deliver intelligent solutions for businesses, with a particular emphasis on crafting Software as a Service (SaaS) products.
